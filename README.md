# hello-world

try again

So I somehow messed up the first time around. I'm creating a new hello world.
I'm just an old man trying to learn a new skill. I decided to go back to school for engineering.
As part of my studies I stumbled across this site where I can learn to write code.
Writing code is important to my development.
